This task will study the electric demand (power) of clients in Portugal, during 2013 and 2014.
The data available contains 370 time series, corresponding to the electric demand22 for 370 clients, between 2011 and 2014.
In this task we use clustering techniques (K-Means) to understand the typical behaviour during 2013-2014.
